# Solution 

Unzipping the contents we find that we have been given a .iso file. So we extract the contents in a separate folder to find the following two extracted files :

Well, googling about .cdda files I found out that it is CD Digital Audio Format, so I went ahead and converted it to mp3 via an online convertor just for the sake of convenience.

Listened to the converted file and it sounded suspiciously like Morse Code, so yea, I took the freedom to go ahead and upload the file in an online Morse Code Decoder.

And we got our flag!
