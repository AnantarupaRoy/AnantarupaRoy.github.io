# FOOTHOLD

Visiting torrent we see that it is a torrent hoster site so we register ourselves and login . This bog was very useful in exploiting it.
[Blog Link](https://infinitelogins.com/2020/08/07/file-upload-bypass-techniques/)

So according to this blog after uploading the torrent we edit it and upload a screenshot. I upload a php reverse shell (renamed it from shell.php to shell.png.php) and I intercepted the request using Burpsuite and changed Content-Type header to image/jpeg and forwarded the request. It shows that it has been uploaded successfully.

After that we visit /torrent/uploads and click on our php file to get a reverse shell as www-data. User flag is in /home/george/user.txt

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

Run the command :

```
uname -r
```
and we see that it is running on linux 2.6.31 

Searching for an exploit via searchsploit we come across many exploits of dirtycow . So even though I was pretty sure that it was unintended I decided to give it a try ( one of my friends had said just a few days earlier that dirtycow exploit and the recent 2021 sudo exploit will run on most machines , so frankly decided to test his words )

[DirtyCow](https://github.com/FireFart/dirtycow/blob/master/dirty.c)

So I uploaded the C file to the machine via python server and compiled it:

```s
www-data@popcorn:/tmp$ gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt
gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt
www-data@popcorn:/tmp$ ./dirty mango
./dirty mango
/etc/passwd successfully backed up to /tmp/passwd.bak
Please enter the new password: mango
Complete line:
firefart:fip9QGsrAJUWg:0:0:pwned:/root:/bin/bash

mmap: b7881000
```

After this unfortunately my (not stabilised) reverse shell got stuck so I had to ssh as user firefart and get the root.txt
