# FOOTHOLD

Searching for iis 6.0 webdav I get these many results from searchsploit :

```
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV 'ScStoragePathFromUrl' R | windows/remote/41738.py
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV Remote Authentication By | windows/remote/8704.txt
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV Remote Authentication By | windows/remote/8754.patch
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV Remote Authentication By | windows/remote/8765.php
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV Remote Authentication By | windows/remote/8806.pl
```
I decided to try the perl and the php scripts but nothing worked . I thought since "patch management" was in the tags it might work but nope, I was wrong again, so I finally tried the buffer overflow script but well, the script got stuck in the middle , so I googled the same script on the internet (hey it did work half) and I got an improved script which was successful in giving me a shell !!

[Improved BufferOverflow Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g0rx/iis6-exploit-2017-CVE-2017-7269/master/iis6%20reverse%20shell)

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

In "Documents and Settings we find a user Harry but we dont have access to his directory . Now in the "All Users" directory's Desktop I found a "Security Configuration Wizard.lnk" so I thought that might have something to do with privilege escalation, but even after a lot of finding when it didn't work I decided to give windows exploit suggestor a try.

It returned various CVEs. I tried a few promising ones  such as ms14_058, ms14_070,ms15_051 but we didn't have all the permissions required to successfully complete these exploits , so I opened a shell via msfconsole and used its local exploit suggestor module which showed me this : 

```s
[+] 10.10.10.14 - exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d: The service is running, but could not be validated.
[+] 10.10.10.14 - exploit/windows/local/ms14_058_track_popup_menu: The target appears to be vulnerable.
[+] 10.10.10.14 - exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl: The target appears to be vulnerable.
[+] 10.10.10.14 - exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image: The target appears to be vulnerable.
[+] 10.10.10.14 - exploit/windows/local/ms16_016_webdav: The service is running, but could not be validated.
[+] 10.10.10.14 - exploit/windows/local/ppr_flatten_rec: The target appears to be vulnerable.
```
I decided to go with the second module (first could not be validated).But it did not give me a shell so on to the third and it did give a shell ( well it took really long for me cuz my vpn would go away every few mins so yea , frustrating , not to mention I had to manually upload nc.exe via meterpreter and run it to get a normal reverse shell because I feel msfconsole shells are a bit slow so I dont understand if it has got stuck or if it is actually executing a command in the background , gotta improve my patience huh? )

User flag was in c:\documents and settings\harry\desktop

Root flag was in c:\documents and settings\administrator\desktop

This box had an easy tag and a whole lot of solves , and was really interesting , but hey had to spend a lot of time enumerating and on errors thrown by metasploit while privilege escalation , but it was an enjoyable machine overall.
