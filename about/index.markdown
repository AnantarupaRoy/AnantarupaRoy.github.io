I am a student at Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad, pursuing my B.Tech in Mineral and Metallurgical Engineering. I have been involved in learning coding since my early teens and I plan on pursuing this interest throughout my college years and my whole life.

I have a deep-rooted interest in programming and Information Security is the branch that interests me the most. Iâ€™m extremely fascinated by Cryptography and forensic analysis and I am very eager to continue learning about the aforesaid fields.

I participate in CTFs with my team [Bit Criminals](https://bitcriminals.github.io/).
