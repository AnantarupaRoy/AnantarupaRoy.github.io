I am a student at Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad, pursuing my B.Tech in Mineral and Metallurgical Engineering. I have been involved in learning coding since my early teens and I plan on pursuing this interest throughout my college years and my whole life.

I have a deep-rooted interest in programming and Information Security is the branch that interests me the most. I’m extremely fascinated by Cryptography, Steganography and forensic analysis and I am very eager to continue learning about the aforesaid fields.

**Technical Knowledge:**
• I am quite comfortable with Python, C++ and Java.
• I am familiar with Visual Studio Code and use it as my primary code editor.
• I am quite familiar with the Linux Operating System.
• I have appreciable knowledge about Git and Github.
